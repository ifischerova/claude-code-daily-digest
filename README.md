# 📰 Claude Code Daily Digest

> I got tired of reading changelogs, so I taught an AI to read them for me — and email me the good parts every morning.

This repo is a tiny, fully automated newsletter. Every day a GitHub Action checks the [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) changelog. When there's a new release, an LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) rewrites the notes as a friendly digest, emails it to me through [Resend](https://resend.com), and commits it here as a permanent archive.

No servers. No cost beyond pennies of tokens. Just a robot doing my reading for me. ☕

## ✨ How it works

```
GitHub Action (daily cron)
  └─ fetch CHANGELOG.md from anthropics/claude-code
       └─ new version? ── no ─► stop quietly
              │ yes
              ▼
        LLM writes a friendly digest (OpenRouter)
              ▼
        email it (Resend)  +  commit it to /digests
```

### Claude Code 2.1.224: Agents talking to agents 🤖

_Claude Code v2.1.224 — 2026-08-07_

**TL;DR** — This release brings powerful agent-to-agent communication, self-hosted runners, and a massive set of stability fixes for a smoother coding experience.

**⭐ Highlight of the release**
Claude Code sessions can now talk to each other! Using `SendMessage` and `ListAgents`, your sessions across different machines can collaborate, share information, and work together on complex tasks.

**What's new**
*   **Self-Hosted Runners:** You can now use your own hardware or containers as the environment for your web, mobile, and desktop Claude Code sessions.
*   **Easier Plugins:** Install plugins directly via HTTPS zip files without needing Git or npm.
*   **Smarter Security:** Enhanced credential masking (including JWT and AWS SigV4 support) keeps your secrets safe even when using advanced sandbox features.
*   **Remote Control Upgrades:** Better reliability, persistent failure indicators, and improved sync between your mobile/web clients and your desktop sessions.
*   **No More Limits:** Removed the 200-subagent-per-session cap, allowing for more complex, long-running agent workflows.
*   **Bug Fixes:** A long list of refinements, including fixes for project path resolution, clipboard issues on Wayland, and better visibility into sandbox access denials.

**Why you'll care**
These updates make Claude Code feel more like a distributed team of assistants rather than a single tool, giving you more control over your infrastructure and better reliability when working across multiple devices.

Happy coding, and enjoy the new superpowers!

## 🛠️ Run it yourself

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add **Actions secrets** (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`):
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — from openrouter.ai
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` — from resend.com
   - `MAIL_TO` — where the digest is sent
3. (Optional) Add **Actions variables**: `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, `MAIL_FROM`.
4. Under **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, choose **Read and write** so the action can commit each new digest back.
5. Enable Actions, then run **Daily Claude Code Digest → Run workflow** to test.

### 🔑 Getting your keys

- **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`** — sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai), open **Keys → Create Key**, and copy the `sk-or-...` value. Add a little credit (the flash models cost a fraction of a cent per digest).
- **`RESEND_API_KEY`** — sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com), open **API Keys → Create API Key** (permission: *Sending access*), and copy the `re_...` value. It's shown only once.
- **`MAIL_TO`** — the address that receives the digest. On Resend's free tier (no custom domain) you can only send to the email you registered your Resend account with, so use that one to start.

The default sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's free-tier address), so you don't need `MAIL_FROM` or a verified domain to get going. Free tier covers 100 emails/day — plenty for one daily digest. Keep every key in GitHub Secrets, never in the code.

Local run (to test before scheduling):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

To run the digest end-to-end locally you must set the environment variables yourself (there's no `.env` auto-loader — `.env.example` just documents what's needed):

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... RESEND_API_KEY=... MAIL_TO=you@example.com
python -m src.main
```

On Windows PowerShell: `$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."` (etc.) then `python -m src.main`.

## 🧱 Tech

Python · OpenRouter · Resend · GitHub Actions. Tested with `pytest`; every network call is injectable so the suite runs offline.
