# 📰 Claude Code Daily Digest

> I got tired of reading changelogs, so I taught an AI to read them for me — and email me the good parts every morning.

This repo is a tiny, fully automated newsletter. Every day a GitHub Action checks the [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) changelog. When there's a new release, an LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) rewrites the notes as a friendly digest, emails it to me through [Resend](https://resend.com), and commits it here as a permanent archive.

No servers. No cost beyond pennies of tokens. Just a robot doing my reading for me. ☕

## ✨ How it works

```
GitHub Action (daily cron)
  └─ fetch CHANGELOG.md from anthropics/claude-code
       └─ new version? ── no ─► stop quietly
              │ yes
              ▼
        LLM writes a friendly digest (OpenRouter)
              ▼
        email it (Resend)  +  commit it to /digests
```

### Claude Code 2.1.210: Smoother sessions and smarter agents 🚀

_Claude Code v2.1.210 — 2026-07-15_

**TL;DR** — This update polishes the agent experience with better reliability, clearer UI feedback, and a handful of important bug fixes.

**⭐ Highlight of the release**
Long-running tool calls now feature a live elapsed-time counter, so you’ll always know your tasks are actively running instead of wondering if Claude has hit a wall.

**What's new**
* **Agent Visibility:** The footer now clearly displays how many background agents need your attention, with a subtle color nudge when something changes.
* **Smarter Permissions:** Auto-mode now uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for more reliable permission classification, and we've added helpful warnings to guide you toward using the correct file access commands.
* **Reliability Fixes:** We’ve squashed bugs related to session crashes, `git worktree` lockups, and intermittent "job not found" errors during attachment.
* **UI Cleanup:** Fixed several "ghost" artifacts, stray characters from copy-pasting, and improved the way the agent dashboard tracks your active tasks.
* **Safety First:** Hardened the Agent tool against prompt injection and added explicit errors if your memory file exceeds read limits.

**Why you'll care**
This release focuses on "quality of life," making Claude Code feel more responsive, transparent, and less prone to those frustrating little glitches that interrupt your flow.

Happy coding, and may your terminal always stay snappy!

## 🛠️ Run it yourself

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add **Actions secrets** (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`):
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — from openrouter.ai
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` — from resend.com
   - `MAIL_TO` — where the digest is sent
3. (Optional) Add **Actions variables**: `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, `MAIL_FROM`.
4. Under **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, choose **Read and write** so the action can commit each new digest back.
5. Enable Actions, then run **Daily Claude Code Digest → Run workflow** to test.

### 🔑 Getting your keys

- **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`** — sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai), open **Keys → Create Key**, and copy the `sk-or-...` value. Add a little credit (the flash models cost a fraction of a cent per digest).
- **`RESEND_API_KEY`** — sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com), open **API Keys → Create API Key** (permission: *Sending access*), and copy the `re_...` value. It's shown only once.
- **`MAIL_TO`** — the address that receives the digest. On Resend's free tier (no custom domain) you can only send to the email you registered your Resend account with, so use that one to start.

The default sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's free-tier address), so you don't need `MAIL_FROM` or a verified domain to get going. Free tier covers 100 emails/day — plenty for one daily digest. Keep every key in GitHub Secrets, never in the code.

Local run (to test before scheduling):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

To run the digest end-to-end locally you must set the environment variables yourself (there's no `.env` auto-loader — `.env.example` just documents what's needed):

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... RESEND_API_KEY=... MAIL_TO=you@example.com
python -m src.main
```

On Windows PowerShell: `$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."` (etc.) then `python -m src.main`.

## 🧱 Tech

Python · OpenRouter · Resend · GitHub Actions. Tested with `pytest`; every network call is injectable so the suite runs offline.
