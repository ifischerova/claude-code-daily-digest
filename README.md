# 📰 Claude Code Daily Digest

> I got tired of reading changelogs, so I taught an AI to read them for me — and email me the good parts every morning.

This repo is a tiny, fully automated newsletter. Every day a GitHub Action checks the [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) changelog. When there's a new release, an LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) rewrites the notes as a friendly digest, emails it to me through [Resend](https://resend.com), and commits it here as a permanent archive.

No servers. No cost beyond pennies of tokens. Just a robot doing my reading for me. ☕

## ✨ How it works

```
GitHub Action (daily cron)
  └─ fetch CHANGELOG.md from anthropics/claude-code
       └─ new version? ── no ─► stop quietly
              │ yes
              ▼
        LLM writes a friendly digest (OpenRouter)
              ▼
        email it (Resend)  +  commit it to /digests
```

### A cleaner, smoother chat experience in Claude Code 🚀

_Claude Code v2.1.201 — 2026-07-04_

**TL;DR** — We’ve tidied up how Claude handles session instructions for a more natural flow.

**⭐ Highlight of the release** — Claude Sonnet 3.5 sessions no longer inject system-level harness reminders in the middle of your conversations.

**What's new**
* We’ve removed the automated mid-chat reminders that were cluttering up your session logs.
* Your interaction with Claude will now feel more like a direct, uninterrupted dialogue.

**Why you'll care** — You get a cleaner workspace and a more focused experience where the AI stays out of your way and sticks to the task at hand.

Happy coding, and may your sessions be distraction-free!

## 🛠️ Run it yourself

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add **Actions secrets** (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`):
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — from openrouter.ai
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` — from resend.com
   - `MAIL_TO` — where the digest is sent
3. (Optional) Add **Actions variables**: `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, `MAIL_FROM`.
4. Under **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, choose **Read and write** so the action can commit each new digest back.
5. Enable Actions, then run **Daily Claude Code Digest → Run workflow** to test.

### 🔑 Getting your keys

- **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`** — sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai), open **Keys → Create Key**, and copy the `sk-or-...` value. Add a little credit (the flash models cost a fraction of a cent per digest).
- **`RESEND_API_KEY`** — sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com), open **API Keys → Create API Key** (permission: *Sending access*), and copy the `re_...` value. It's shown only once.
- **`MAIL_TO`** — the address that receives the digest. On Resend's free tier (no custom domain) you can only send to the email you registered your Resend account with, so use that one to start.

The default sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's free-tier address), so you don't need `MAIL_FROM` or a verified domain to get going. Free tier covers 100 emails/day — plenty for one daily digest. Keep every key in GitHub Secrets, never in the code.

Local run (to test before scheduling):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

To run the digest end-to-end locally you must set the environment variables yourself (there's no `.env` auto-loader — `.env.example` just documents what's needed):

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... RESEND_API_KEY=... MAIL_TO=you@example.com
python -m src.main
```

On Windows PowerShell: `$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."` (etc.) then `python -m src.main`.

## 🧱 Tech

Python · OpenRouter · Resend · GitHub Actions. Tested with `pytest`; every network call is injectable so the suite runs offline.
