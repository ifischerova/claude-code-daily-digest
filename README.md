# 📰 Claude Code Daily Digest

> I got tired of reading changelogs, so I taught an AI to read them for me — and email me the good parts every morning.

This repo is a tiny, fully automated newsletter. Every day a GitHub Action checks the [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) changelog. When there's a new release, an LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) rewrites the notes as a friendly digest, emails it to me through [Resend](https://resend.com), and commits it here as a permanent archive.

No servers. No cost beyond pennies of tokens. Just a robot doing my reading for me. ☕

## ✨ How it works

```
GitHub Action (daily cron)
  └─ fetch CHANGELOG.md from anthropics/claude-code
       └─ new version? ── no ─► stop quietly
              │ yes
              ▼
        LLM writes a friendly digest (OpenRouter)
              ▼
        email it (Resend)  +  commit it to /digests
```

### Claude Code 2.1.196: Smoother sessions and smarter agents 🚀

_Claude Code v2.1.196 — 2026-06-30_

**TL;DR** — We’ve polished background agents, improved session management, and added handy quality-of-life features to make your coding flow feel more seamless.

**⭐ Highlight of the release**
Background agents are now much more resilient; if your session process is interrupted or a daemon restarts, your work will automatically resume right where it left off instead of getting lost.

**What's new**
* **Org-wide defaults:** Admins can now set default models for the whole team.
* **Clickable files:** You can now Cmd/Ctrl-click file attachments in chat to jump straight to them in your Finder or Explorer.
* **Organized sessions:** New sessions now get readable names automatically so you can find them later.
* **Refined Agents:** We fixed several UI bugs in the agents panel, including better status labels so you know exactly when an agent needs your input.
* **Smarter Code Reviews:** Your `/code-review` workflow is now 25% more token-efficient.
* **Security:** Better handling of untrusted workspaces to keep your MCP servers safe.

**Why you'll care**
This update removes the friction from long-running tasks and makes navigating your workspace—whether through file links or better-named sessions—significantly faster.

Happy coding, and enjoy the smoother experience!

## 🛠️ Run it yourself

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add **Actions secrets** (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`):
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — from openrouter.ai
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` — from resend.com
   - `MAIL_TO` — where the digest is sent
3. (Optional) Add **Actions variables**: `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, `MAIL_FROM`.
4. Under **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, choose **Read and write** so the action can commit each new digest back.
5. Enable Actions, then run **Daily Claude Code Digest → Run workflow** to test.

### 🔑 Getting your keys

- **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`** — sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai), open **Keys → Create Key**, and copy the `sk-or-...` value. Add a little credit (the flash models cost a fraction of a cent per digest).
- **`RESEND_API_KEY`** — sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com), open **API Keys → Create API Key** (permission: *Sending access*), and copy the `re_...` value. It's shown only once.
- **`MAIL_TO`** — the address that receives the digest. On Resend's free tier (no custom domain) you can only send to the email you registered your Resend account with, so use that one to start.

The default sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's free-tier address), so you don't need `MAIL_FROM` or a verified domain to get going. Free tier covers 100 emails/day — plenty for one daily digest. Keep every key in GitHub Secrets, never in the code.

Local run (to test before scheduling):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

To run the digest end-to-end locally you must set the environment variables yourself (there's no `.env` auto-loader — `.env.example` just documents what's needed):

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... RESEND_API_KEY=... MAIL_TO=you@example.com
python -m src.main
```

On Windows PowerShell: `$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."` (etc.) then `python -m src.main`.

## 🧱 Tech

Python · OpenRouter · Resend · GitHub Actions. Tested with `pytest`; every network call is injectable so the suite runs offline.
