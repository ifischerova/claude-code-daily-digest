# 📰 Claude Code Daily Digest

> I got tired of reading changelogs, so I taught an AI to read them for me — and email me the good parts every morning.

This repo is a tiny, fully automated newsletter. Every day a GitHub Action checks the [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) changelog. When there's a new release, an LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) rewrites the notes as a friendly digest, emails it to me through [Resend](https://resend.com), and commits it here as a permanent archive.

No servers. No cost beyond pennies of tokens. Just a robot doing my reading for me. ☕

## ✨ How it works

```
GitHub Action (daily cron)
  └─ fetch CHANGELOG.md from anthropics/claude-code
       └─ new version? ── no ─► stop quietly
              │ yes
              ▼
        LLM writes a friendly digest (OpenRouter)
              ▼
        email it (Resend)  +  commit it to /digests
```

### Claude Code 2.1.205 is here with a smarter, smoother experience 🚀

_Claude Code v2.1.205 — 2026-07-09_

**TL;DR** — This update brings major stability improvements, a more helpful `/doctor` command, and a much cleaner dashboard for managing your background agents.

**⭐ Highlight of the release**
We’ve overhauled the agent dashboard: instead of reading raw technical logs, you’ll now see clear, color-coded status labels and human-readable headlines for every task, making it instantly obvious what your agents are working on.

**What's new**
*   **Health Checks:** The new `/doctor` command now acts as a full diagnostic tool that can identify and automatically fix common setup issues.
*   **Safer Automation:** Claude is now more cautious, asking for your permission before running risky commands like `rm -rf` on unclear file paths.
*   **Better Reliability:** We’ve squashed a variety of bugs, including Windows-specific crashes, file-handling errors, and issues where background tasks would get stuck in the wrong status.
*   **Efficiency:** The auto-updater is now much lighter on your system, reducing peak memory usage by 400 MB by streaming downloads directly to disk.
*   **Clearer Communication:** Background task notifications now explicitly flag when no human input has occurred, so you never have to worry about accidental approvals.

**Why you'll care**
These refinements make Claude Code feel less like a collection of scripts and more like a reliable teammate that knows when to ask for help and when to get out of your way.

Happy coding, and let us know what you think!

## 🛠️ Run it yourself

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add **Actions secrets** (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`):
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — from openrouter.ai
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` — from resend.com
   - `MAIL_TO` — where the digest is sent
3. (Optional) Add **Actions variables**: `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, `MAIL_FROM`.
4. Under **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**, choose **Read and write** so the action can commit each new digest back.
5. Enable Actions, then run **Daily Claude Code Digest → Run workflow** to test.

### 🔑 Getting your keys

- **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`** — sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai), open **Keys → Create Key**, and copy the `sk-or-...` value. Add a little credit (the flash models cost a fraction of a cent per digest).
- **`RESEND_API_KEY`** — sign up at [resend.com](https://resend.com), open **API Keys → Create API Key** (permission: *Sending access*), and copy the `re_...` value. It's shown only once.
- **`MAIL_TO`** — the address that receives the digest. On Resend's free tier (no custom domain) you can only send to the email you registered your Resend account with, so use that one to start.

The default sender is `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's free-tier address), so you don't need `MAIL_FROM` or a verified domain to get going. Free tier covers 100 emails/day — plenty for one daily digest. Keep every key in GitHub Secrets, never in the code.

Local run (to test before scheduling):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

To run the digest end-to-end locally you must set the environment variables yourself (there's no `.env` auto-loader — `.env.example` just documents what's needed):

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... RESEND_API_KEY=... MAIL_TO=you@example.com
python -m src.main
```

On Windows PowerShell: `$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."` (etc.) then `python -m src.main`.

## 🧱 Tech

Python · OpenRouter · Resend · GitHub Actions. Tested with `pytest`; every network call is injectable so the suite runs offline.
