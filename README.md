# 📰 Claude Code Daily Digest

> I got tired of reading changelogs, so I taught an AI to read them for me — and email me the good parts every morning.

This repo is a tiny, fully automated newsletter. Every day a GitHub Action checks the [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) changelog. When there's a new release, an LLM (via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)) rewrites the notes as a friendly digest, emails it to me through [Resend](https://resend.com), and commits it here as a permanent archive.

No servers. No cost beyond pennies of tokens. Just a robot doing my reading for me. ☕

## ✨ How it works

```
GitHub Action (daily cron)
  └─ fetch CHANGELOG.md from anthropics/claude-code
       └─ new version? ── no ─► stop quietly
              │ yes
              ▼
        LLM writes a friendly digest (OpenRouter)
              ▼
        email it (Resend)  +  commit it to /digests
```

## 📬 Latest digest

<!-- LATEST:START -->

_The first scheduled run will drop the latest digest here._

<!-- LATEST:END -->

Browse every past edition in [`/digests`](./digests).

## 🛠️ Run it yourself

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add **Actions secrets** (`Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions`):
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — from openrouter.ai
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` — from resend.com
   - `MAIL_TO` — where the digest is sent
3. (Optional) Add **Actions variables**: `OPENROUTER_MODEL`, `MAIL_FROM`.
4. Enable Actions, then run **Daily Claude Code Digest → Run workflow** to test.

Local run (to test before scheduling):

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

To run the digest end-to-end locally you must set the environment variables yourself (there's no `.env` auto-loader — `.env.example` just documents what's needed):

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... RESEND_API_KEY=... MAIL_TO=you@example.com
python -m src.main
```

On Windows PowerShell: `$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."` (etc.) then `python -m src.main`.

## 🧱 Tech

Python · OpenRouter · Resend · GitHub Actions. Tested with `pytest`; every network call is injectable so the suite runs offline.
